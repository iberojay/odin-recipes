        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This smash burger recipe makes juicy burgers with crispy edges. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of butter (softened)</li>
                <li>1 pound of ground beef (80% lean)</li>
                <li>4 (6-inch) squares of parchment paper</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>4 slices of American cheese</li>
                <li>Burger toppings of choice</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat stove top for high heat and set cast iron flat-top griddle or large
                    large cast iron skillet onto stove and preheat until smoking.</li>
                <li>Spread butter on the insides of the buns and toast until lightly browned</li>
                <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Don't pack the meat tightly,
                    as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the the pan and cover
                    meat with a piece of parchemnt paper (prevents sticking of spatuala). Immediately
                    smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that 
                    are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down.Afterwards 
                    sprinle meat with salt.
                </li>
                <li>Let the meat cook for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brownedand the centers are a light 
                    pink colour. Using a spatuala, gently scrape up the patties, flip opver and immediatley 
                    cover 4 of them with cheese. Cook for an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties 
                    so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favourite toppings.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
